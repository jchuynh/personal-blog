excerpt: "My software engineering journey and the little bits of knowledge I acquire along the way!"

Hello, I’m Jessica! I’m currently transitioning from a biotech lab technician to a software engineering role. I created this blog to document my journey into the tech industry and to discover what works for me in terms of learning. For a bit of background, I discovered coding when I was working as a lab technician analyzing data. Manually it took about 90 minutes to process. This was not efficient. So, I collaborated with a data scientist to create a Python script that only took the computer 3 minutes to process. You could say I was inspired by the free time I could give back to my team. This was the beginning of my journey as a software engineer.
